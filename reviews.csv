Movie 1/125:

This was one of the best rom coms I have seen in awhile. There was a great level of comedy, an ok story, and some unbelievably attractive people. Sydney Sweeney is a goddess and the love of my life. Glenn Powell is a stud. Honestly my goal is just to become his character in this movie this year (jacked, rich, unable to swim). I will definitely rewatch this in the future (even if it’s just to see more of Sydney Sweeney)","theater, with kaitlyn, amc lincoln square, laser",2024-01-02

Not going to lie I didn’t read anything about this prior to watching. All I knew was that Jacob Elordi was in it. Not at all what I was expecting. The way the whole thing was shot was awesome. Otherwise it was dark, creepy, and purposefully snobby. Way too much full frontal from my guy Ollie in the last scene for my liking. Also I saw on Twitter mid movie that the bathtub is at the Alamo Drafthouse in Brooklyn which is like 10 min from my apartment. Maybe I’ll go for a walk and get a good lick in.

Edit: Just thought about this the following morning. The whole thing was about him not belonging at Saltburn. He was not in that social and economic sphere but was faking it to be a part of what Saltburn was. The one thing that kind of kept him grounded to who he was and what his past truly is, is the watch he was wearing. I love that watch. First one I bought for myself when I started getting interested in watches. It’s a cheap ~$20 digital Casio with a metal bracelet. It’s a classic and appears nicer than it truly is. Everyone knows it’s cheap though. Kind of like Ollie.",prime video,2024-01-04

Kaitlyn and I went to Au Cheval tonight, a burger place that we have had a gift card to for the last year. Incredible burger at this place. While we were there we decided to come back and watch a movie. Usually when we try to pick a movie it takes like 30 min and one of us doesn’t actually want to watch it. Today was different. While I didn’t have a strong desire to watch this, it seemed good enough and Kaitlyn said she loves it.

The movie itself wasn’t particularly great. The Luke and Sophia story was mid at best. The only thing they had going for them was being hot. I really liked the Ira and Ruth story though. There’s something so nice about 1940s love stories. If the movie ditched the entire bull riding, sorority girl bit, it would’ve been 10x better.","max, with kaitlyn",2024-01-05

I put this on just to have something on in the background while I had coffee and breakfast. It’s fine. The live action Disney movies are all just a cash grab to be honest. I’m not sure why the girl got so much hate, she does a pretty good job and the songs all hit exactly how you’d want. Scuttlebutt is an awful song though. Actually startled me when it came on. Unfortunately these live action movies will just never capture the magic that the originals have. Maybe that’s just because I am older now, but I can’t imagine these having the same magical feeling for kids as the original movies do",disney+,2024-01-07
2024-01-11,Godzilla Minus One,2023,https://boxd.it/5ywNOp,5,,"Movie 5/125:

I had absolutely no idea what to expect going into this movie. Honesty, I was shocked it was still playing in theaters. I had heard that the movie was good, but my brain kind of drifted towards “this is going to be dumb CGI of a monster fucking up Japan”, and I was a little skeptical. All of this to say that this movie fucking rocked. The storyline was beautiful and Godzilla is dope af. Watching Japan continue to get nuked by this giant monster after the hardships of WWII is essentially their own continuation of the deadliest war man has ever known and a continued nightmare. Combine that with the emotional storyline and you have this kick ass movie. 

One other thing I couldn’t help but think about was how the prominence of Godzilla in Japanese culture must have led to some of the weird shit they are into now. Take that thought as you will.","theater, with steve, amc 34th st",2024-01-09

I recently watched the first Now You See me and I think this one lives up to the exact amount of hype as the original. It’s good but it’s not anything particularly special. Maybe I’m just not a huge magic fan but there’s nothing about these movies that makes me go “Wow!” like I feel I should. The thing that is crazy about these movies is the cast. It’s no wonder the third hasn’t come out yet. So many stars in one room must be hard to get everyone together.

2024-01-17,Oppenheimer,2023,https://boxd.it/5CbfFH,5,Yes,"Movie 7/125:

I just need to start with saying WOW. I was so bummed when this was originally out in theaters because I missed out on seeing it at Lincoln Square which is the only theater with proper IMAX 70mm anywhere in the tri state area. The wait was so worth it though. IMAX 70mm is no joke. Even months after it was originally in theaters, each showing was sold out this week. 

The movie itself was so immersive and an unbelievable audio and visual experience. My seat was a little closer to the front than I would have liked but it almost added to the sheer size of the screen and beauty of each scene. Truly an experience like no other. 

As for my second watching of the movie, the story is honestly better with a rewatch. I’d argue that when I watch it a third time that the story will be even better. Having an understanding of what is happening, who the characters are, and the timing of each scene gives the viewer a deeper appreciation for the quality of what is being displayed.

One last fun thing to note, the dude next to me was either eating food that smelled like literal shit or kept ripping ass throughout the movie. Either way it was no match for Robert J. Oppenheimer.","imax 70mm, theater, amc lincoln square, imax, rerelease",2024-01-16

This is more of a documentary than a movie, but I don’t care, it counts towards the goal. I make my own rules. Overall this was a great watch for a baseball fan like myself. Nolan Ryan is the epitome of country hard ball. He exudes American spirit and I wish I was alive when he was pitching. The best part of watching stuff like this is having all the super old timey stories of guys who had to face him and what their experiences were like. They use such interesting adjectives and the way they tell the stories are so dramatic, it’s the best.","netflix, documentary",2024-01-19

I decided to put this movie on since I have recently been on a binge of watching YouTube videos about Michelin star chefs and what it’s like to be in their kitchen. This movie basically felt like a 1hr 40min version of those YouTube videos. The big different is the addition of the character plot and what not. I loved the action of the kitchen. Story was fine but nothing particularly special. Bradley Cooper gives a great performance. The biggest issue I had with the story is that it felt very forced having Tony be in love with Adam. It fit in some ways but it felt like it was forced to fit and would have been fine not being in the story at all. 

Also Adam Jones is a former MLB ALL-Star, so shoutout to him for his successful career switch. Now he will forever be a big league all star and a three Michelin star chef.",netflix,2024-01-19
2024-01-23,Armstrong,2019,https://boxd.it/5F4hQP,3,,"11/125: 

Another documentary to the list. To be completely honest this was one of those watches I had on in the background and had to stop halfway through and pickup the next day. Despite this, it was a super interesting watch. Armstrong is one of the most iconic people in history and I am a sucker for anything having to do with NASA’s history. Space was one of my first niche interests. I actually did a whole project as a kid listing out a timeline of Armstrong’s life and I put the timeline on a cutout of a Saturn V rocket that I drew. This guy is the ultimate American Hero 🇺🇸🦅. 

Another thing I liked was thinking about watching First Man by Damien Chanelle with Ryan Gosling, and comparing it to this. First Man did a great job hitting on little details of his life and Apollo 11 specifically. It also did a great job on casting actors who looked like the real life people.","documentary, peacock",2024-01-22

It did mention at the end that he wrote about the locals and their stories from where he lived in the 40s so I guess this fits that bill. Either way it was just odd.

That was long and a lot to absorb. All around a good watch, incredibly well made, great cast, and amazing performances. That being said, I don’t think I’ll ever watch this again. It’s just not a movie I’d consider super memorable or noteworthy. My favorite part of watching movies is talking about them with people afterwards and striking up conversations about movies. The thing I’ll bring up for this movie is “oh you’ve seen it too… cool.”

One thing I did really enjoy was how you could see the town and area evolve as the movie went along. At first it was little structures with not much going on. By the end it was a full blow Main Street with everything you could want and little suburb style houses nearby. The evolution idea also applied heavily to Leo’s character. He started super bummy and scene by scene he was leveling up his appearance with new clothes and cleaned up style.","with mom, apple tv",2024-01-27
2024-01-29,Loki,2021,https://boxd.it/5HRx2H,4,Yes,"14/125:

This definitely shouldn't count towards my goal but I am doing it anyway. New rule is that if I watch it and it is available to log on Letterboxd, than it counts. Sorry if anyone disagrees.

So I just watched season 2 all in one go today. Loki is by far the best content Marvel has released in what feels like ages. Tom Hiddleston is magnificent and Loki is one of the few characters from the early phases that is still around. I think that is part of the reason that myself and many others have taken such a liking to this show and him. It may also be that the show itself is just very good. It's such a unique and fun story, how could you not like it. 

My favorite thing about this show is easily the set designs. Whether its the funky style of the TVA that looks straight out a Frank Lloyd Wright building that has 40s, 50s, 60s, & 70s inspiration, or if its one of the many settings they travel through time to go to, everything looks so perfect.

My least favorite part of this season is the length and Johnathon Majors being included. As for the length, why can't Marvel produce content that is 10 episodes. Why spend hundreds of millions for 6 episodes. I finished it in one sitting. The people need more. For Johnathon Majors, it sucks to see him in this because he does such a great job, but you know he will never be back in Marvel because he's a scumbag in real life.","disney+, with mom",2024-01-27

This was infinitely better than expected. When I saw trailers it seemed like it would be a meme movie. After watching, it was the perfect balance of touching all the incredible memes that came as a result of WSB and also hitting on the serious topics of Wall Street fucking the little guy. Also what a fucking cast. Why did I not know this would be a solid, rewatchable, movie?

There were a few things that irked me though. America Ferrara is way too cool and hot to play the role she was in. I need someone who’s a little rougher around the edges to play that role. She’s too perfect. I need someone who lives in the trenches of Reddit and is a certified Discord mod in that role. 

The other issue I had was that in one of the first scenes, Keith is taking the PATH to go visit his Wall Street buddy. The logistics of this are possible but don’t quite make sense. The movie takes place in Massachusetts, why is he in Jersey in the first place? Let’s say that maybe he flew into Newark from Boston, he could hypothetically take the air train to Newark Penn and then hop on the PATH and get off at Journal Square, but why would he. They are trying to emphasize that his buddy is a wall st guy. Make him live in Manhattan… I guess the guy could live in Jersey City, but unless you’re a douche like me who is thinking in detail about this, make the guy live in Manhattan. I did love the Journal Square path station recognition though. Shoutout Dante Giugliano.",netflix,2024-01-28

I was recommended to watch this by coworkers last week and I wanted to make sure I followed up by actually watching. This was fun and exciting, the type of “horror” that I love to watch. Like many other reviews have said, the idea of “rich people bad” is a little boring, but this movie does a good job at portraying it. Not sure why the chef is pretending that he isn’t an elite like his customers though. You ain’t special buddy. 

While watching, this felt like a more exciting version of Hell’s Kitchen and Midsommar. Two pieces of media that couldn’t be further apart but mesh together so well. Thanks for the recommendation by the NYC NTT crowd. You know who you are.",Hulu,2024-01-29

Really thought this would be better. Maybe I just had high hopes because it’s a baseball movie. The story is sweet and nice but the movie is just bad. Aside from Dennis Quaid the acting is just awful. The kids aren’t good actors. The teenage versions of them also can’t act. Just all around bad.

The worst part about sports movies, specifically baseball movies, is when they cast people who clearly have never played before. Baseball is a game that requires fluid motions. You have to play to be able to look like you play. It’s the only sport that you can’t just pick up even if you are the greatest athlete alive. When they cast actors who clearly have never played it looks awful. They talked about Rickey’s arm being great but you could tell it was shit just by watching. Same with his hitting, they never show him actually swinging, and it’s because he looks like an idiot who’s never held a bat before.",hulu,2024-02-01

Not sure what just happened. I imagine this was the 70s version of how my generation felt about Everything Everywhere All At Once. The biggest difference between the two though is the lack of slurs in Everything Everywhere All At Once. Honestly though it was interesting to watch actors use all of those slurs and deliver those lines with such confidence and seeming lack of second thought. I just wonder how edgy this was when it actually came out. Like what was the general public thinking?","max, with mom, franks list of must watches",2024-02-02

Why do movies on cable never fit to the screen size correctly? There was a massive bevel around the actual movie the whole time. So dumb. 

Movie itself was fun, had a cool concept, and a lot of great actors with good performances. There’s a reason I had never heard of this though. Nothing special. My favorite part was seeing Amy Adams and hearing her use the same southern accent that she uses in Catch Me If You Can. Something about her😍.

That was awesome. Bradley Cooper really gives a fantastic performance. His makeup artist deserves an award because they Jew’d him up real well.

Throughout each chapter of the movie, I loved how the style of scenes matched the decade it fell. Even beyond just starting in black and white and transitioning to color, the early scenes felt as though they captured the aura of the 30s or 40s with still frames that let you follow the scene with your eyes. The later decades in the 70s were raw with emotion and energy with the scenes being shot through the charisma of the character.

I also really enjoyed how the story went through the dual double life that he was living. He loves music but was always torn between different avenues. Likewise in his personal life, he adored his wife but could not escape his desire for the men who charmed him. The story did a great job detailing the beauty of both sides of his life and the anguish both could bring.

I’m not usually a big crier during movies, but the scene where she was diagnosed with cancer hit me deep in my feels. There’s something about the way they held each other in such a vulnerable moment that felt so pure and hit me hard.

Not sure why people give this such a bad wrap. Bradley Cooper is great. Should he win an Oscar? No. But that shouldn’t take away from this movie at all. The idea that it has nothing to say is BS in my opinion. Nothing is explicitly laid out for you and that is the beauty.","netflix, with mom",2024-02-03

This is as pure of a mid 2000s movie as it gets. For that exact reason it is awesome. I immediately could sense that this was the movie that planted the seed for the hard-on every man and woman now has for Channing Tatum. He’s a stud. Can’t argue it. Amanda Bynes is in her absolute peak here as well. She was the it girl of this era and it was because of these kinds of performances. It’s a shame she fell off so hard.

The big pitfall of this movie is the absurdity of the concept they “pulled off”. She looks nothing like her brother and there are just way too many opportunities for someone to catch her on not being a dude. Too unbelievable for my liking.

I did really enjoy the simple and stupid humor of her pretending to be a guy. I just imagined my girlfriend in this scenario and how funny it would be listening to her try to pretend to be a bro. The scene where she says “Holler atcha boy” made my lose it. Too funny.","netflix, with kaitlyn",2024-02-11

I fell asleep halfway through. Let’s start with that. There’s not much this movie offers in terms of quality. There’s a lot of boobs though. That helps for sure. Also a sneaky good cast. Not sure how they convinced all these actors to sign up for this shitty movie.

This is a cute little movie. Laney and Zack make for an adorable pair and fit perfectly in all the stupid stereotypes for this type of movie. Jock is convinced to go for nerdy girl and figures out she’s perfect and teaches him more about himself than he knew before. The two also have an incredibly perfect height difference.

The fall offs of come from the fact that the story was horrific. Timing wise everything makes no sense. How is Zack admitted to all these ivy’s and simply doesn’t just enroll. I get the whole idea is that decisions don’t need to be made and they can live vicariously as life comes at them, but that’s just not how life works. And for her, the art teacher is just now reaching out to schools during the week of prom? Prom is at the very end of the year. Enrollment deadlines are in May…

The movie description also makes it sound like soccer is going to play a large roll in the movie. There’s maybe 1 scene with soccer.

Taylor’s character is also way too much of a bitch. We’re people really that mean to each other in the late 90s in high school. I can’t imagine people speaking to each other the way they do in this. She’s also not nearly as attractive as Laney is once Laney reaches her final form.

Last comment: Paul Walker should have been the main character. Everyone comments how Zack is the best looking guy in school throughout the movie. This is simply not true. Paul Walker’s character is. Dude is a specimen. Zack is scrawny. They should have switched roles.

So I just learned that all the 30 for 30s are available on ESPN+ and are on Letterboxd. This is going to be a cheat code for getting to 125. To my loyal followers, be prepared for a plethora of 30 for 30 logs. I am going to be in the trenches and an unstoppable force.

As for this documentary, growing up in a different era of Mets baseball, I had no idea how much had gone wrong is Gooden and Strawberry’s lives. My understanding of their lives and careers looked like this: phenoms come on the scene and shine bright, flash forward in time and they hit lows, drug problems take control, and they make it back. Little did I know there was so much more between the lines of the reality I thought to be true.

These two men are the prototype for what a pitcher and hitter should be. Literally made in a pan. The documentary comments on this well, but the “what if” questions behind these two are just immeasurable. Gooden was maybe the most dominant and pure pitcher to ever live. Strawberry had it all for a position player: Power, speed, arm, glove, and IQ.

It’s truly a shame how addiction took control and brought them both to unimaginable lows. It is also nice to see how Darryl has found purpose and rebuilt his life. Doc’s situation is worrisome. They didn’t have a good happy ending for him. He seems to still be troubled with his addiction. I remember last year or a few years ago the Mets brought back old timers day, an opportunity for Mets legends to come back and play a few innings and get cheers from the Met faithful. Doc came and threw the first pitch. His uniform was baggy, he looked skinny, and people were worried for him given his history with drug abuse and addiction. I hope he has found peace and overcomes these issues. Him and Strawberry for their wrongs and low moments will always be considered greats and remembered for their shining movers as New York Mets","hulu, 30 for 30, documentary",2024-02-25

This is my second time seeing this but watching something in IMAX 70mm gives the experience an entirely new perspective. The first time I watched Tenet I remember leaving the theater completely lost but enjoying everything the movie had to offer visually and audibly. This time around the audio and visual aspect of the experience were infinitely better and the story actually made a little bit more sense.

As a result of understanding things a little bit and having the ultimate movie experience, I have decided to up the review by an entire star. You’re welcome Christopher Nolan.

The one thing that I appreciate about this movie in this viewing experience is the amount of the movie that is shot in the IMAX 70 mm film. Compared to seeing Oppenheimer, it felt like 80% or more of Tenet was shot in this style. It adds such a unique depiction of the experience one will have. Also loved the shoutout to Oppenheimer like 3 times within the movie. Who knew the Nolan Cinematic Universe was so vast.","theater, imax 70mm, with steve, amc lincoln square, imax",2024-02-27

The most exciting part of this movie is that it’s my first movie since upgrading to AMC A-List. Felt like a celebrity not gonna lie. I can’t believe I haven’t been taking advantage of this for longer.

The movie really wasn’t great. I am not familiar enough with the history to appreciate it, but the story telling did very little to help me. I also struggled really badly with understanding the accents lol. I wish there was a more linear approach to telling the story of his life, I would have understood and enjoyed the story more.

My only other thought coming out of this is that if I ever watch this again I need to keep a count on how many joints are smoked. I knew Jamaicans like them some weed, but the amount they were smoking was wild. Impressive af though. Have to appreciate that element of Marley’s greatness.","theater, amc 34th st, laser",2024-02-29

One day I will have a Mets team that will climb the mountain and bring me joy. I might be dead before that happens but I root for it every day.

This documentary was fantastic. While I am massively biased, it tells a beautiful and complicated story. The Mets have always been the laughing stock of baseball, but for just one season (actually a couple of you think about it) none of that mattered and they brought a city together and brought it back to life.

I already knew the vast majority of this story so the highlight of the doc is easily the interviews. Lenny Dykstra is a fucking psycho and letting him talk freely to a camera was a great decision. Keith Hernandez is a legend. If he kept his persona from the 80s through to today he wouldn’t be the same weirdo I watch in the Mets broadcast booth every night. Glad he had Hadji in almost every interview clip. It’s a shame they didn’t make this 10 years ago and get Gary Carter in an interview. My dads favorite player of all time, RIP.

Truly a comically bad movie. So bad that the woman that was sitting next to me in the theater fell asleep, started snoring, and listening to her snore added a better element to the viewing experience than anything the movie was producing.

What’s unfortunate is this story has potential to be really cool. The backstory to Uncle Ben and the story of peter’s birth. With this limitless potential, absolutely nothing was taken advantage of. Even with a half decent class, including the love of my life Sydney Sweeney, this garbage was not salvageable.

This may be a hot take, but I actually thought the Pepsi ads with handing her a Pepsi and using the Pepsi Cola location in Queens was clever. Probably the only redeeming quality this movie had to offer.","theater, amc 34th st",2024-03-05

I was hoping the entire time that this would become the classic Roald Dahl story and it just never did. I think Timmy is great and has the potential to be a great Willy Wonka but this movie tried to become a great story based on a classic. The story they created was just not easy to fall in love with like the original. The original captures the beauty of what your imagination can create. Aside from all the weird shit that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is actually saying if you psychoanalyze it, it’s a fantastic story. Gene Wilder’s movie adaptation is even better. I could watch that movie over and over and enjoy it every time. Can even say the same thing for Johnny Depp’s version. Depp’s version is just weird as shit. I’m sure that they wanted to go away from the classic story as it would be overplayed to make a third, but I think this should’ve been just that.

This movie was…interesting. I could see the play being good because it was intentionally campy but this doesn’t feel intentional or satirical.

Kaitlyn picked out this movie because she saw the original French version in high school and said that she cried throughout the entire movie. She may have fallen asleep for most of this one, but I think it lived up to the hype that she set for it.

Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston are a fantastic duo and balance each other extremely well. Great heartfelt story. Bryan Cranston in my opinion is one of the greatest actors to ever live. He plays this character so well given the fact that he literally could not move anything besides his head.

IMAX 70MM strikes again. It’s just breathtaking. Not much more to say beyond that. A movie could be complete shit and that format would make it impressive.

This movie though, I was skeptical. Everyone hyped it up as the greatest sci fi movie series in since LOTR and Star Wars. After watching the first one last night and being pleased but somewhat underwhelmed, my expectations were met and often exceeded during this movie. At times it is slow and confusing and other scenes have you as captivated as you have ever been at a theater.

It pains me how much I like Timmy from this performance. He really is a great actor and fucking kills it as Paul Atreides. The thing that always bothers me about Timmy is just how scrawny he is and how punchable his face is. I think this kinda helps him be a better actor though. If Timmy looked like Chris Hemsworth or Ryan Gosling, he wouldn’t be half the actor he is. He is blessed with that scrawny frame. It propels him to stardom.

Really excited for the rest of this series. Along with the amazing experience in the theater, the story seems amazing and draws you in so easily. I loved all the parallels to real life. Not a big reader but who knows, maybe this will convince me to even give the book a try.","theater, imax 70mm, amc lincoln square, imax, rerelease",2024-03-20

The sole intention of this movie is to be nostalgic. I imagine the intended audience is a parent and their child. The parent grew up watching the originals and they are bringing their kid to this movie to show them how cool and great ghostbusters is.

For someone like myself who is childless and didn’t really grow up watching the originals. This movie was not particularly engaging or good. The story is weak and the OG cast, particularly Bill Murray, looked like they didn’t even want to be there.

That was a lot of fun to watch. Don’t get me wrong, the story is awful and completely ridiculous, but the scenes where Kong and Godzilla were going sicko mode were fucking awesome.

When it comes to the story, it’s one of those things where you just give up on the idea of, “I could maybe see this happening in an alternate reality”. You just sit there watching a big ass Gorilla and Monster showing up in major countries, cities, and wonders of the world, wreaking havoc, and just having to accept that this is the reality of what’s going on. Oh and don’t forget, they go through fucking portals to Middle Earth or some shit. Once you get past the ridiculousness, the action takes over and has you smiling as you root for the big gorilla.

The action is great. Truly the biggest standout of the movie, but my favorite part is when there is just the big ass animals and monsters and they are just making noises at each other. Somehow, someway as the viewer you know exactly what those grunts, howls, and screams mean and they get you fired the fuck up for the excitement that is bound to unfold.","theater, amc 19th st, with steve, 3d",2024-04-09

Anything in IMAX is automatically a good movie. Civil War is good, but I think could seriously benefit from an additional 20 minutes of added lore about the breakup of the United States. 

It’s kind of wild to have a movie that is centered around the idea of a rogue president and the succession of different states and then only provide a few minutes of lore and one or two scenes that actually include the president. 

I understand that the idea of this civil war is just a way to talk about the real focus of the movie which is war photography and war journalism, but at least give the lore the time of day. Would’ve made this at least a 4.5/5.

Also, the journalist guy who travels with them but isn’t a photographer should not be in the action. He’s a warm body with no gun, no purpose, and gets in the way. Even if he is a writer or something, he’s still in the way and shouldn’t be there. Get your info some other way and write about it that way.

Another fantastic recommendation by Kaitlyn. 10/10 all around. The story is so heavy yet simple all at once and the viewer gets such a personal feel throughout every scene. There is something beautiful about movies where there is no specified direction but the flow of the movie moves without any hiccups in an obvious direction.

All the little interjections of detailing his traumas flashbacks are so perfectly timed and well done it keeps you questioning and engaged with what you will learn and experience next.

Emma Watson is the perfect person to play Sam. She is wonderful and beautiful. Her accent slips a few times but you have to let that slide. Ezra Miller is such a great actor. Dude might be crazy but that’s usually what helps actors be so great. Lastly, Logan Lerman is actually amazing in this.

Zendaya truly is the finest specimen in the world. Completely fair for these two guys to fight over her for multiple decades. If I was a star tennis player in 2006, I would also be pining over her.

Loved the movie aside from the ending. The way the story was told was really engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Zendaya’s character really drives the story through your constant skepticism over which character is the good guy and which isn’t, so you never quite know who to root for. All along though the person you should be rooting against is Zendaya. Her character is a slimy bitch who is really just out for herself. If it weren’t for her injury during the movie she probably never talk to these guys after she went pro.

Really struggling to decide between 4.5 and 5 stars. On one hand, I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie and there were no dull moments. On the other hand, the movie ended and I felt dissatisfied and wanted the story to wrap up better.

As sad as it may be, this is the first time I have ever seen any of the original 6 Star Wars movies. I saw that for the 25th anniversary Episode 1 was coming back to theaters for May 4th weekend and knew it was a sign to finally give these a go. I’m going to try and watch all of Star Wars now. To what extent that will be I am not yet sure, but for all my loyal fans who actually read the shit I write on here, I promise that I will at least get through the OG movies.

Episode 1 was good, not great. From what I can see it does a good job at introducing a lot of important characters and if you were watching it when it originally released, would be great because it is elaborating on the story you already know and giving much more context to what happened originally. 

For me, going into this trying to watch in chronological order, I was mega confused for the first 20 or so minutes. The viewer seems like they should be expected to know what’s happening. I did not. That wasn’t a big deal once more characters were introduced and the plot was elaborated on further as time went on.

I thought some of the VFX were cool. Not sure if it was good for 1999 but it wasn’t the lamest stuff ever.

Wow that was so much better than the first two. Actually a crazy good movie. I really understand why Anakin would go to the dark side. If I was with Padme, I’d do the same. I’d do anything for Natalie Portman.

The story, the action, the effects, the emotion, all around were top notch. It’s a shame that this is the first time I am watching these and didn’t grow up with this stuff. I did play all the Lego Star Wars games as a kid though so it has been fun pointing out all the scenes I remember from the games.

One thing I loved about this movie in particular is how they shot every scene with Anakin being in the shadows vs in direct light like Obi-Wan was. It does such a great job eluding to what will come. 

I also now understand why my buddies kept saying that Padme would be at her peak in Episode II. Shit checks out.

Set design, cast, and overall production quality on this kinda go crazy. It’s not a good story, or even a particularly engaging one, but it’s fun and good showing for the whole family. 

I think Seinfeld knew exactly what he was doing here. Make a movie literally anyone could watch at any age and just dump money into the cast and production so it seems high quality and star studded. He nailed it on his execution of that. He probably always knew the story never had to be anything and ignored it’s relevancy the entire shoot on purpose. Kinda genius.

I am sure most of the planet of the apes movies are like this, but since I haven’t seen any other than the 2011 and OG one from the 60s or 70s, I was pleasantly surprised with how much they play on the unique dynamics of humankind, evolution, power structures, morality, and curiosity. All of these intricacies are touched on and elaborated upon so well and leaves the viewer in thought about each topic.

This movie encapsulates both of those things so well and while I am barely Irish, the story hits so close to home as it mimics much of what my grandparents and their families went to when coming to America. It was a joy to understand what it must been like to take such a big leap and come to this country.

This is one of those movies where you are missing out if you don’t go to IMAX. Literal sound you can feel. Every <i>vroom vroom </i>of the janky motorcycles or the <b>VROOM VROOM</b> of the big ass diesel Mack trucks will have your seat literally shaking.

I know most of my reviews just make me sound like a slut for IMAX, but I think I just have to embrace that because IMAX showings are fucking awesome.

This movie has you locked in like no other. The action is intense, immense, and all consuming. There are so many instances were you realize after 15 or 20 min of pure raw action that you forgot where you are and there is a whole reality outside of the action you are enjoying. Pure bliss one could say. Genuinely some of the best action I’ve seen in any of my movie going experiences.

The one flaw I have is that I don’t understand the story. There’s so little background context. I understand that’s probably intentional, but I enjoy when the lore of a story is fully fledged out.

I loved the romanticization of Japan and Tokyo (Dream trip for me). Did not love some of the mocking of Japanese people by Bill Murray, but I’ll blame the director for that.

Review from a special guest star. The beautiful Kaitlyn Rose Simpson.

“Inside out 2 perfectly embodies the feelings every young person (especially girls) feel when they are going through puberty. We feel that desire to fit in and change everything we have to in order to be like the people we think we should want to be. I wonder if some of us never ditch that mindset and spend our lives with an altered sense of self that mutates to fit in to the newest cool crowd. 

Additionally, as someone that deals with anxiety, I felt so seen by the way they portrayed anxiety in the mind. Sometimes I wish had more joy in my own mind to save me from that anxiety. 

Highly recommend this movie to people who love to get in their feels.”","theater, with kaitlyn, amc lincoln square, imax, kaitlyn cried, i got teary eyed",2024-06-20

This review has almost nothing to do with the movie and is more me writing about my weekend and how this movie fit into the timeline of what happened. Feel free to read about my life :)

I went to Chicago this weekend to go see watch the Mets play at Wrigley Field and explore the city with my parents. Overall a great weekend. Beautiful city, incredible ballpark, and great times (aside from picking to go to the one game the Mets lost all weekend).

My flight back was out of O'Hare to Newark and I knew it was going to be a rough travel day. 9:35 PM flight that gets in at ~1:00 AM EST. From there I knew I was going to crash on a friends couch in Newark and then take a series of trains back to Brooklyn the next morning so I could work from my apartment. 

The flight was delayed a bit and I ended up with a middle seat. Not ideal but could be worse. Once I got on, a nice Jewish couple ended up being in my row (I think the man was a Rabbi), and they let me take the window seat so they could sit together. A huge W for me. 

To my surprise, this must have been one of United's newer 757 planes. It had a really nice entertainment system in the seat in front. I had been meaning to watch The Boys in the Boat for awhile after my girlfriend's mom recommended it so I decided to throw it on. 

Another cool part of the entertainment system was that I could connect my Airpods to it and use them instead of wired headphones. This was awesome until I realized I couldn't hear a thing and had to switch to the headphones anyway.

I did fall asleep several times during the movie but it seemed very good. I feel like this and the movie Race are very much similar given they take place at the exact same time and are about sports at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. I love the comradery surrounding organized sport so it was a good pick.

The flight landed on-time despite the late departure. The movie wrapped up as I was deboarding. I paid for an overpriced Lyft to my friends apartment. Slept on a couch. Took the NJT Light Rail, PATH, and Subway for an hour, got through my morning meetings, and am now back at my lovely apartment in Brooklyn writing this review.

I seem to be in the minority here, but I am really disappointed with this movie. It was marketed so well and I was so hype to watch it. Even Kaitlyn was hype to watch, and it felt like a huge let down.

I understand that they probably knew they needed to go a completely different direction and that’s why the main focus on this one revolved more around Lupita already knowing death was around the corner and these alien fucks kind of giving her the opportunity to end things on her own terms and take control of her life again. This just isn’t what I hoped for when I went into the theater.

The original and even the second were so creative, had clear directions, and created so much tension surrounding the idea of silence for safety. This new one does none of those things. It’s not that creative since it’s just playing on all the tropes of the originals and does nothing particularly new. There is almost no direction behind the story, just getting to Patsys and the South St. Sea Port. And the tension was just not that great. It had its moments and being in theaters for thrillers is always more fun since the speakers are loud as fuck and you can feel the jump scares.

To wrap up, I will cover my only bright spots of the movie. 1) The acting is great. Lupita Nyong’o and Joseph Quinn are a fantastic duo and really do an excellent job with what they were given. Still not even close to as good as Emily Blunt and John Krasinski unfortunately. 2) New York City got romanticized. Any movie that does that gets extra stars.

The way I watched this movie fit perfectly with what the movie does to its viewer. Edging to the extreme.

Every moment is so tense and then nothing happens. The build up is so immense and then there’s nothing coming from it. Disappointing to say the least.

The way I watched it was in three parts. First on my flight from LGA to ORD like 2 weeks ago and left it on a high note. Then picked it up waiting for my flight at ORD. During this stretch it disappointed me and built me all the way back up. Then my final watch was on my phone in my bedroom in Brooklyn. And once again the movie got all tense and cool just for absolutely nothing to happen.

If I had seen this in a theater I bet my opinion would be drastically different. I also think that if I hadn’t chosen to watch the second trilogy before watching this trilogy, maybe I would have enjoyed this more.

Movie has all the makings of a great horror thriller but really just misses the mark a few times with the plot. Cinematography was great, acting was great, plot was mid at best. Still a fun movie experience nonetheless.

Also quite difficult to take Nick Cage seriously in this type of role.","theater, with wilson, with wilsons roommate, amc alderwood mall, seattle, laser",2024-08-10

Actual Review that no one wants:

This felt like a great introduction to the Alien franchise. Going in IMAX to the opening night showing was also really fun.

As far as I understand the movie tried too hard to tie back to the original and that was its main downfall. I could definitely see how that was the case as there were so many things that were just breezed over context wise. Understandable for fans who have seen all the movies, but for an alien virgin like myself, this made everything feel a bit rushed story wise.

They did a great job getting you invested in the characters quickly. Andy and Rain had me hooked and rooting for them from their first scene. I also am in love with Cailee Spaeny I think. 

The jump scares, while miserable in the moment, were really well done. They got me every single time. The ending really fucked me up too. Every time I thought they were safe and beat those alien fucks, they would just show up out of nowhere. Id definitely go see another one of these if more are released or if they are re-released.","theater, amc lincoln square, with steve, imax, opening night",2024-08-16

2024-08-20,Deadpool & Wolverine,2024,https://boxd.it/78SNvD,4,,"106/125:

I love self-awareness. Deadpool is so great with that. This third iteration is so unbelievably self aware it’s truly incredible. Countless self deprecating jokes, digs at Marvel, digs at Fox, digs at the Avengers & X-Men, and digs at the actors personal lives, it was all perfect. It knew exactly what it needed to be and delivered.

That being said, there were almost too many references and witty jokes for the audience to be able to pick up on them all. I consider myself a pretty big movie buff, especially with Marvel given my cruise trivia abilities (Iykyk), and I also certainly know my pop culture thanks to Kaitlyn, but I only caught maybe 75% of the jokes/references. Simply way too many for the general audience who don’t know their shit like us Letterboxd users.

I will admit that having not seen Logan is my biggest regret prior to this theater experience. I should have known to finally watch before going. I am dumb and it was regrettable. It’s funny too because I took a whole summer a little while back and watched all the X-men movies. I just never got around to Logan. I also saved it on my phone for one of my trips recently and still didn’t watch it. Probably watched stupid Game of Thrones or something. I’m a dumbass…

I was impressed with the cast of characters they brought back and the cameos they were able to afford. Disney simply has infinite money and sometimes that is a good thing.","theater, amc 34th st, with dante, laser",2024-08-19

This was a lot of fun and not nearly as scary as it could have been. Honestly found myself, and most of the theater, laughing more than anything. Can’t say the same for Kaitlyn unfortunately. She was a bit frightened.

I will give Kaitlyn a lot of credit though, she figured out the whole thing within 20 minutes. She’s so damn smart.

Story itself was pretty good. A few points that are a bit ridiculous, but that’s half the fun with horror movies.

Whatever this was does not qualify for a rating.

I was trying to count how many times I thought to myself, “what the fuck is going on?”, and lost track around 52 instances.

Whole thing felt like I was dreaming, which was super confusing cause I fell asleep halfway for like 5-10 minutes. Waking up and realizing this strange display of visuals, loosely strung together stories, and various sounds were still occurring had me fucking confused.

I was begging for this to end. Over two hours of trying to follow a pure train of unconsciousness is mentally exhausting, especially for a 10:30 pm showing.

Last comment, that dude Shia Lebouf definitely just showed up each day, improvised as himself, and went home. He’s a freak. Perfect for whatever that role was.","theater, amc lincoln square, imax, fell asleep, is this a movie?, with steve",2024-09-28

<b>125 Movies in 2024:</b>

To all my fans, thank you for joining me in the journey to 125 movies this year. Back around Christmas of 2023 I was chatting with family about how I wanted to get more into watching movies and the overall movie culture. I decided I wanted to make a resolution/goal for 2024 to watch 125 movies.

Since then, I have made endless memories with friends & family surrounding the world of movies. Whether it be going to the theater, date nights on the couch, chatting about this app with folks who don't know about it, or exploring the various theaters across NYC, this year has been so much fun getting more involved in movie culture. 

What makes me so excited for the years to come is that I have learned there is so much more to this world of movies than I previously knew and I could take this passion any way I wish.

Thanks to anyone who I have seen a movie with this year, chatted about movies with, or let me yap about movies & letterboxd. You have been key contributor to this journey. It really does mean a lot to me.

For 2025 I plan to have a new goal: 50 movies in theaters. Can't wait to share that new journey with all who wish to join.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
<b>Moana 2 Review:</b>

I purposely made sure Moana 2 would be #125 as the first movie holds a lot of sentimental meaning to me. 

I knew from the jump I would not love it the same way I love the original. It is often too hard for sequels to live up to the glory of their predecessor, and Moana 2 is just the same. 

Disney has the unfortunate issue of needing to come to these glorious resolutions at the end of movies, since they are for children. This usually prevents a sequel from being able to pick up where the first movie left off, forcing the sequel to almost act as a standalone with a brand new storyline, conflicts, and it's own resolution all within an hour and a half. Difficult to do, but Moana 2 does a good job. 

There are a few songs that really stood out and hopefully I am still jamming to them a few years from now the same way I do for the OG.","theater, amc 34th st, with kaitlyn, opening night",2024-11-26

Turns out the UWS fucking sucks and has no late night food and the stupid train is running local. Sad.

As for the movie, it is complicated but also simple. I have so many thoughts but my brain is empty when it comes to elaborating on any of them. I think there is such beauty in this when a movie provides you with this experience. 

There’s so many different things I could write this review about. It could be about the immigrant experience in America, American ideologies post WW2, American greed, generational trauma, addiction, or an endless amount of other topics. Instead of diving into one of those I think it is better to just mention the fact that this movie brings light to all of them and allows the viewer to explore each topic in their mind on their own or when talking with others. This is something that makes movies the most social and beautiful art out there.

Also, I fucking loved the intermission. Getting a break so I could go pee was so unbelievably nice. A great opportunity for a short debrief and a bathroom break. Need more movies to do this.

Is it Bob Dylan? Is it Timothée Chalamet? Is it still Buddy the Elf? Maybe it’s Melo? Juan Soto maybe (LFGM)?

Given his recent press tour and the impending success of this movie, I honestly think it might be Timmy. He’s so fucking talented. His portrayal of Bob Dylan (from the perspective of someone who only knew about Bob Dylan through the trend of wearing a short light jacket in the freezing cold), seemed excellent. It’s a confused man with thoughts blazing through his head that can only come out through literature in the form of music. Going to and from women, with no remorse for their feelings, in search for utilizing the feelings they provide him as a medium to write more music. 

I am absolutely amped to obsessively listen Dylan’s music for the next week straight. If you have any recommendations please let me know :)

I of course knew that this was going to be a classic since it is so highly regarded, but I was glad to not have any spoilers or even know what it was about going into it. I only realized about half way through that this was the movie where Brad Pitt asks what is in the box. Unfortunately for Mr. Pitt, I had a strong feeling of what was going to be in said box and I ended up being correct.

Younger Brad Pitt and peak Morgan Freeman are outstanding together. Previously I had only seen Pitt in most of his recent roles where he plays a much more adult like figure (i.e. Moneyball, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, etc.), but as I watch his roles in older movies like Ocean’s, Fight Club, and now Se7en, I see just how great he was early in his career. He’s charming, spastic, charismatic, and makes you really connect with the emotions of his characters. Freeman is his own realm. He’s stoic, equally charming, and brings you along with his curiosity so damn well.

This is definitely a movie that is going high up on my list of “glad I got around to watching”, and I am equally as glad it was on that beautiful big silver IMAX screen.

This score has been a bit of a culmination of the recent days and this showing. The movie has gained a ton of great buzz, I snagged tickets for a showing with a live Q&A, and the movie itself ended up being really fucking good.

The Q&A raised the obvious question of “Why the monkey?”. The answer was simple yet made so much sense as to why I really enjoyed this compared to other biopics I have seen. He is depicted as a CGI monkey because the focus of every biopic ever from a viewers perspective always ends up being focused around how well the actor portrays the person. When you remove that element it narrows down the viewers focus in the story, emotions, and vulnerability that is being shown. Weird, for sure, but excellently done.

While I learned that through Q&A, it is absolutely not mentioned during the movie itself, which I honestly think is a huge drawback. Especially in the U.S., people don’t really know who Robbie Williams is. I think there isn’t as much incentive to find out when you think you’re just seeing some movie about a pop star monkey, which is absolutely what I thought going in.

One thing I desperately wish was brought up in the Q&A, but was not, is why this a being marketed so heavily in the U.S. People here really don’t know who he is. I hope word of mouth marketing helps here though because the film really was excellent.","theater, with steve, q&a, amc lincoln square, cried, matinee, robbie williams, laser",2025-01-12

2025-01-22,Nickel Boys,2024,https://boxd.it/8zlQZB,4,,"I’m tremendously torn writing this review and over my rating 

On one hand, I was begging for this movie to end. It is slow, long, and at times feels as though there is not enough substance to balance out all the creativity.

On the other hand, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a film quite like this one. The POV style and frequent interjections of photos, videos, and history felt so special and unique.

Leaving the theater I know this movie will win some sort of awards because of how well made it is and just how creative the film portrays itself. I just also hated it for making me bored out of my mind for 2 hours until things started clicking. Maybe I’m just dumb and need my hand held, but I just couldn’t fully connect with the story or the emotions that were coming across.

This score may change based on how I feel when I wake up.","theater, amc lincoln square, laser",2025-01-21
2025-01-23,Talk to Me,2022,https://boxd.it/8A28Kt,4,,"If there is one thing this movie does really well, it is that it is effective in scaring you shitless for ~1hr 30min.

While I personally would never hold a ceramic hand to allow dead spirits enter my body, I can completely understand why, if you equate this to euphoria via drug use, you may want to chase the dragon to heal whatever you are feeling inside.

Having something at your fingertips that will make you feel on top of the world and ease all your dark thoughts is hard to pass down. Add that with the ability to reach further and further for that feeling until it brings you pain in all elements of life and it makes sense why these stupid Ausies are doing this at parties.

Overall, great vibes and excellent scare factor. Misses the mark a little with the story and emotion it wants you to feel.



Also, for those keeping track, this is movie #6 in theaters on the year and the 2nd horror movie in theaters on the year (3rd if you count <i>Babygirl)</i>. Doing well on the 2025 goal!","theater, amc lincoln square, imax, a24, rerelease, with steve",2025-01-22

I spent about 1hr 30min thinking to myself repeatedly how I had no idea what was going on. The repeat confusion led to a few moments of questioning my ability to comprehend movies and whether I was worthy of being the movie snob I aspire to be. The remaining 1hr or so helped solidify my aspiration of snobiness.

I felt as though I understood what was happening. I felt like I could connect with the characters. I felt like I too was having an existential crisis personified on the big screen.

I am so glad that I had no idea what the movie was about or really any preconceived notions about Lynch's work up until about 15 min before the screening. The ability to go into a work like this with an open mind and a willingness to allow the experience and emotion flow through you as it happens is priceless.

Her name is Roo, she’s a 5-6 months old rescue. Roo is a cuddly and loving girl and I am so glad I got to watch this as my first watch with her. 

I have had <i>When Harry Met Sally</i> at the top of my list and absolutely adored it. Something about the comedic simplicity, the natural chemistry between the two, and of course the epitome of New York City romanticism were just exceptional.

2025-02-18,I'm Still Here,2024,https://boxd.it/8SjFmF,3.5,,"As expected from all the buzz surrounding this movie ahead of the Oscars, Fernanda Torres is amazing. To be frank, that’s really all this movie has going for it though. 

The story is slow and mostly uneventful. It’s a great depiction of this poor women’s most tragic life event with her family as a result of governmental corruption. You are really transported to 1970s Brazil and brought along through the triumphs and tragedies throughout her life. It’s nice seeing her life evolve beyond the initial cruelty to make something positive of what happened. Especially nice seeing her family beside her through all of it. I am sure if I knew more about the history of Brazilian political affairs I’d take a greater appreciation for the story as well.

Not sure what was missing but there was never much of an it factor beyond the telling of the story, the amazing performance of Torres, and some great cinematography.

Still rooting for Mikey Madison to win Best Actress, but won’t be too bitter if Torres sneaks in there for the victory.","theater, amc lincoln square, laser, with justin, oscar noms 2025",2025-02-17

2025-02-25,Inception,2010,https://boxd.it/8WqGuP,5,,"Questioning reality is such a fundamental concept to human existence. As we continue question what is real, how things work, and why things behave the way they do, we continue to evolve. It’s very much so the reason we as a species have come as far as we have (or maybe it was shrooms…).

Whether you believe in the stoned ape theory or not, this questioning of reality makes for an exceptional concept for a film. Combine that with the 🐐director and you have this masterpiece. 

The only thing I really knew going into this was that my high school comp sci teacher used the concept of dreaming within dreams to explain loops and recursion to us. Clearly I didn’t understand that at the time since I was told I would fail the AP exam if I took it. What’s funny is I still don’t really understand the concepts now 7 years later. I do think that made me enjoy it more though. As I began to try and piece together a coherent story with logic that could be followed, I realized the true storyline was devolving more and more as we fell deeper and deeper into dreams within dreams. As we devolved we fell further and further into Leo’s characters subconscious to the point where we truly did not know whether reality was reality or where we were. 

The ending is honestly perfect. His subconscious placed him in the exact place to forgive himself but allowed room for questions of reality to continue with the top spinning with the possibility of falling but not allowing the viewer to see. Well done Nolan. You never fail to amaze me.","netflix, with mom, with roo, mom slept",2025-02-23
2025-03-01,Oppenheimer,2023,https://boxd.it/8Z3W4p,5,Yes,"It’s really hard to capture in a series of sentences the profound effect this movie has for me. Since I do care about my fans and want to provide my best effort to share all my thoughts, please enjoy the following lists of why this movie is so important to me.

1. <i>Oppenheimer</i> was released at the ideal period in time for the film to become a microcosm of what this hobby and passion has become for me. The release came after Covid and brought people back into the theater. I had just become a true movie enjoyer. My obsession grew as a result of learning more and more about film, different types of projection, and allowed me to appreciate art on a deeper level.

2. The film is fascinating in that it captivates viewers for 3 hours despite the majority of the screen time just being people yapping. Engagement and captivating in artistic style were never relevant to me before watching this movie.

3. I look forward to learning something new in the nuances of each watch. At this point I have seen the movie 4 or 5 times. Each and every time I take a greater appreciation for the story and how it is told. I learn or recognize something completely new with every watch/screening.

4. IMAX 70MM… Oppenheimer will always be the first movie I have had the opportunity to view in this format. There’s truly nothing quite like it and there are few words to describe how powerful this viewing experience is with this format. I am privileged to be able to go to screenings on a regular basis with the greatest screen in the country. For those that haven’t experienced it yet, make it a priority to see something in IMAX 70MM during your lifetime.

5. Oppenheimer revived the movie going experience. With credit to Barbie as well, the in theater movie going experience was under serious threat of going extinct prior to the summer of 2023. Since then, theaters are seeing larger crowds. Regardless of how the theaters are doing, going to see Oppenheimer in person, combined with all the other factors I mentioned above have driven a passion of mine that I hope never disappears. There is nothing quite like the in theater movie experience.

Thanks for reading if you made it all the way through this. Love my fans❤️","theater, amc lincoln square, imax 70mm, with steve, imax, rerelease",2025-02-28

From the various bits of chatter I’ve heard, ratings I’ve seen, and reviews I have read, it seems like people went into this expecting a specific style and were disappointed that their that expectation was not met.

Since I had no expectation and this was my first movie with the directors style, I was in love because I was fortunate to come with such a fresh perspective and open mind. <i>Mickey 17</i> felt fresh and creative. It was satirical but not in an overly intentional manner. It employs an incredible cast who get to the opportunity to embellish such outrageous, yet believable characters. The premise is simple and genius, but also so complex and perfectly timely with today’s cultural and political climate. It was a lovely, hilarious, and brilliantly done movie. 

Even with how much i genuinely enjoyed this, my thoughts kept going back to trying to understand why others didn’t. Why are my peers comparing this to previous works so heavily and filling their minds with expectations. To be fair, this is normal. When I first saw Jordan Peele’s <i>Nope</i>, I left the theater disappointed. I built the movie up to be this politically charged thriller in my mind before entering the theater. When my expectation wasn’t matched I was left wishing I had been fulfilled. Looking back on it, <i>Nope</i> was a fantastic movie. It wasn’t Peele’s prototypical narrative, but it was brilliant nonetheless. A few years from now, I hope that<i> Mickey 17</i> is viewed in the same way for those who were let down with their first watch.

2025-04-14,A Minecraft Movie,2025,https://boxd.it/9pbyrp,2.5,,"This definitely itched a deep feeling of nostalgia in the back of my brain. Minecraft has always been, and very much still is, one of my favorite games of all time. Seeing Jack Black impersonate Minecraft Steve is almost surreal and I am not sure that far Jacob as a kid would believe that this movie is real.

Either way, the movie made me think a lot about all of the amazing memories I have of playing as a kid (and adult for that matter). I originally got the game in 5th grade and I distinctly remember my first world. I had a very simplistic 4 story house with ladders all over to climb to each multi functional level. There were farms, storage, a mine, just about everything in that little house. What I remember the most was being so afraid of the mobs at night looming in the distance as the dark came every 20 minutes of real life time. 

Over the years I played in hundreds of different worlds, played hundreds of hours with friends, built houses, farms, went splunking, etc. The game was always evolving and was always a familiar comfort that you were sure to have so much fun with every time you logged on. 

To this day, I watch YouTube videos about Minecraft. I may not have the time to play much at all, but this outlet has always been such a fun way to keep living through others experience of the joy this game has brought me.

I don’t really have much to say for the movie other than that it was fun and I am so grateful for those memories to have popped up in my head again. I do wish the story that was told was more in line with Minecraft’s general chronology of loading in, gathering tools and food, mining, getting armor and tools, going to the nether, enchanting, and going to the end to defeat the dragon. This would’ve made the movie so much better for me. There were just a few too many liberties taken with the story that was told for me to properly enjoy it.

What Ryan Coogler provided to us as viewers is truly magic. The smooth transitions to full aspect ratio were some of the most incredible moments I've had at a theater. I was truly in awe.

Aside from the wow factor of 70MM IMAX, Sinners was honestly pretty great. Michael B. Jordan is in a league of his own. The ability to play two completely unique characters who you become equally as invested in is special and the presence of his characters is felt almost immediately and carries throughout the duration of the movie. The only reason I did not go for 5 stars here is that I am not a fan of vampire movies. I tend to think they are kind of lame. With that in mind, this story and movie does it really well and draws some interesting comparisons to the mobility of a vampires to Jim Crow era America. There's limited places and times of day you can be out and seen, who you can interact with, etc. Not sure if that is what Coogler was going for but I thought it was a neat comparison.

He was certainly correct with that statement. I was pretty confused for the entirety of the 113 minute run time. Even so, I did enjoy the movie to some degree. Maybe not during the actual screening, but definitely during our Starbucks debrief. Sometimes having a true film bro explain a movie to you really helps. Otherwise I would not have really understood the simplicity of what the movie was getting at under the layers it was presented in. 

At its core, the movie was about changing times and the human desire to progress. This family came over as enslaved people, were freed, and had their roots dug deep to the island where they lived. The elders in the family wanted to stay and not leave behind the land and spirits of their entire family, dead or alive. The younger parts of the family were in search of more, progress, opportunity, freedoms, and hope through religion. There’s definitely a few more layers to touch on than this boiled down version, but that’s just what I picked up on.

Somehow it was easier to understand this after the fact than during the run time. Most of the showing I sat there thinking to myself, damn Steve was right, this really is out there.","theater, walter reade theater, lincoln center, with steve, 35mm",2025-05-04

The movie does a great job at going back to some of its roots with simple characters with real human issues and flaws. Covering mental health, depression, and loneliness as the medium for Bob’s character and lore is a timely and appropriate way to win over the masses and touch on a very critical issue impacting everyone in today’s world.

The thing that drew me in the most is how much this movie really was just a setup for later movies in this phase of the MCU. To be fair though I don’t even know what phase are we even in at this point. Marvel has lost me so much in the last few years this felt like a last ditch effort to really draw me in. Frankly it has worked. Without spoiling anything, I am very excited to see what is next. The MCU is entirely flawed but will always bring out some laughs and excitement allowing you to escape your own reality for a few hours.

Speaking of flaws, it did feel like this was full of them. Basically nothing substantial happened aside from one moment where NYC went dark (this is maybe the 30th time this has happened in MCU history). Bob almost went down the path of becoming the new most powerful creature of all time for absolutely no reason. The real villain was mainly ignored for what seems like future projects to cover. Everything felt like it was just filler for later on to get us hooked and connected with the characters. If this is the case, then so be it. It is how the MCU became so iconic in the first place. Create a connection with the characters and let the rest just fall into place. Hoping for the best with what is to come.","theater, amc lincoln square, imax, with dante",2025-05-08

Yeah kind of at a loss for words. I am not very familiar with Tim Robinson’s work so this one was a bit of a blind spot for me. The movie is filled with a ton of laughs, especially from the crowd who all clearly was had a wealth of previous Tim Robinson knowledge. 

Aside from the laughs the direction was all over the place, likely intentional. I didn’t understand the relationship with the wife (fine btw). And just didn’t really get what the fuck was happening through the constant 2nd hand embarrassment.

I thought this was going to try to be a piece on loneliness in today’s society and the difficulties men have forming friendships as they age, but I am not sure that was what was happening. I think it was much more of a barrage of hyper fixations. Each hyper fixation was centered on chasing this dragon that he believed friendship and relationships are all while ignoring the current and important ones he already had.

Jokes aside, this is what the movies are all about. Pure movie magic throughout the theatrical experience. 2.5 hours of 1.9:1 action, drama, comedy, and a bit of romance.

I got into F1 a few years back, even made it to the Monaco Grand Prix back in 2022 and felt like the poorest person there. I have been so unbelievably amped for this to come out and combine two of my favorite pieces of entertainment.

Now also imagine you have a movie about yourself but the entire viewing experience is actually a depiction of you being so stoned or fucked up that you are actually browning out.

That’s Inherent Vice in a nutshell.

This was an extremely difficult to follow stream of detective work that seems to mimic how your brain functions after you had a few too many joints. 

At some points you feel locked in and as if all your thoughts are clear. The next thing you know you are trying to understand why a golden tooth holds the key to every mystery that has ever been presented to you.

This back and forth between clarity and chaos also lends for some interruptions for emotion.

2025-07-14,Superman,2025,https://boxd.it/akqANF,4.5,,"Sometimes low expectations are a blessing. 

Going into the screening I was expecting another bland superhero movie with little substance, some action, and half decent engagement. Leaving I was fully engaged, was shocked by the quality of action, and extremely pleased with the overall quality of movie.

Obviously the Superman story is by no means new, but James Gunn was able to take the story and layer in several layers of his movie magic to produce what was honestly an excellent film.

This adaptation does a wonderful job covering a series of classic themes and touches on extremely relevant social, cultural, and political themes.

The classic themes of lawful good and chaotic evil are quite clearly present though Superman vs Lex Luther. David Corenswet and Nicholas Hoult honestly could not have been much better. Corenswet seems like he was meant for this role. Hoult certainly shines though. After watching <i>Juror #2, </i>it was nice to see his acting actually shine through.

The other relevant themes are so well done by playing into today’s reality. Socially and Culturally, the relevance of the news and media could not be more important. Throughout the showtime, different forms of media are shown and present a glimpse into the metropolis society. Like many of us today, we accept every new social media post or talk show interview as the ultimate truth. We are fed information without questioning its validity. True journalism, like that of the daily planet is lost until everything goes to hell. Stories are shared without remorse. 

Politically, it is quite evident the parallels to today. Corruption, leaders without empathy, big corporations having their cake and eating it too, countries interfering where they don’t belong, the list goes on.

Maybe this is what allows Superman to work so well. A relatively simple story of true good that everyone can relate and aspire to and the complications of humanity that make it difficult to reach.

When I think about what 2020 get vivid flashbacks of chaos. Mask mandates, fights in supermarkets, police conflict, rise in social justice and political consciousness, villainizing/praising individuals for their acts of protest/violence, conspiracy, etc. Aster found a way to build it all in the small town of Eddington.

I love the constant state of confusion and the progressive uneasiness throughout the movie. Each element draws you back in time to what your life was like having to read through social media, tuning in to the news, being fed lies and conspiracies left and right. While some of these experiences we only saw through our phone, computer, or tv screens, in Eddington we got to experience them all.

I don’t even know why I love this. Maybe it’s the Rittenhouse comparison being a white apologist. Maybe it’s “antifa” flying in private jets across the country to cause mayhem and political uprising. Maybe it’s the fact that in the end the only people who won was the massive corporation building a data center that will wreck this small community and rip out whatever sense of heritage that is left. Whatever it is that made me love this, I hope you all find the same enjoyment I did and get to laugh and smile throughout the whole film.","theater, amc 34th st, laser, with dante, with justin, front row, a24",2025-07-18

I avoided reviews, acquiring any knowledge of the movie, or developing any preconceived ideas before going into the theater. Despite this, I knew that my expectations would be met to a T.

This movie exemplifies all elements of modern day Marvel. Big budget, big names, incredible marketing/advertising, unbeatable aesthetics, and a pretty bland movie.

I understand these are not new characters. I understand that this is just setup for a larger movie in this phase. I just wish there was something to give the movie a bit more life and depth. There was a glaring lack of comedy, only present in small bursts and mostly from Joseph Quinn (icon btw). The characters felt bland and not relatable.

There are really only two things I took away from this:
1. The aesthetics of this movie are absolutely phenomenal. You are transported and immersed directly into a comic book world. Its settings, vibes, and world are complex, well thought out, and utterly impressive.
2. Like I mention from most showings at the Lincoln Square IMAX theater, movies are made from the big screen. While there was a disappointing amount of 1.43:1 scenes in this movie, compared to what it was hyped up to have, the big silver screen still is just astounding and the perfect way to watch a film.","theater, amc lincoln square, imax, with dante",2025-07-26

Felicity Jones is so incredible as well. She is just as much a star as Eddie Redmayne in my opinion. And boy is she beautiful.

The story is also just incredibly lovely. Centering around one of the most brilliant minds of the last 100 years, I expected a science heavy plot line. I was mistaken and glad for it. The theory of everything can be explained with mathematics down the road, but math can not explain things like human behavior, family dynamics, and the power of love.

2025-08-24,Freakier Friday,2025,https://boxd.it/aQ07AN,4.5,,"Off the bat, some of you may be surprised by this score. 

Let me start with the following:
1. Lindsey Lohan was at my screening (see link at the end for a picture)
2. The audience made this movie experience 10x better than if I went alone and the movie fucking rocked.

As the first bullet mentions, yes I happened to stumble into a screening with a surprise appearance from the star herself, Lindsey Lohan. It’s rare that Kaitlyn will proactively tell me she wants to come to the theater and see something with me. Fortunately Freakier Friday is very much so in her wheelhouse so we picked a day and bought some tickets. 

There wasn’t really anything abnormal to start. Normal showtime, normal seating options, normal booking. When we arrived at the theater we were informed of a special voucher all Freakier Friday moviegoers were recording of a free small popcorn and soda. Huge win because this would’ve been $30 otherwise. Still not thinking too much of it. Lincoln Square has some advertising and special promotions at times.

Then we walked in.

Camera crews scattered across the outer perimeter of the walkway. Lighting equipment at each corner. Clearly something was going on. 

Once we arrived at our seats we had to have a few girls move as they were in the wrong seats. As they moved we heard them mention how they were told to sit wherever they wanted. Now the suspicion began to rise.

Kaitlyn and I chatted the person sitting next to us who mentioned that he booked a ticket because he saw Lindsey Lohan post on social media that she was in NYC and coming to AMC Lincoln Square.

Now we are freaking out. What the fuck had we stumbled upon? I go to a lot of cool screenings, but nothing like this had ever happened before.

A DJ is playing music and doing trivia for Freakier Friday popcorn buckets all throughout the chaos. People are waving green and purple pom poms all over the theater. 

Quick side note: the pop corn buckets for trivia had $500 AMC gift cards. Truly wish I won one of them.

Eventually the DJ had us singing the song from the movie as Lindsey came to the front of the theater. A bit surreal watching her thank everyone for coming and throwing out tshirts to the crowd.

After she wrapped up the camera and lighting crew spent 15 minutes manufacturing the perfect pictures for their social media. Honestly it was quite dystopian. From it outside perspective on social media it probably looked like this genuine surprise interaction. In reality it was a cool experience that was overshadowed by the reality of real life being manipulated to be idealized for the masses online. Left a slightly sour taste in my mouth.

Nonetheless, the movie was outstanding. A perfect sequel (something Disney usually struggles with). Jamie Lee Curtis had me cackling and on the verge of tears.

The authenticity to the time period was genuine and pure. The acting, aside from Chad Michael Murray, felt reminiscent of early 2000s Disney. And the nostalgia hit on all fronts.

Such a memorable experience. Can’t wait for more memories at my favorite theater

Unfortunately I do think this is the least compelling of Nolan’s movies I’ve seen so far. The surprise towards the end you could see coming from a mile away.

Not knowing anything about my last two movies going into them (Lurker and this), the topic of obsession vs love is front and center. The approach in each is wildly different. Lurker was dark, deep, complex, and probably not great for a mainstream audience. The Prestige is all the same but with Nolan’s thorough storytelling.

Seeing the two A-List stars of Bale and Jackman obsess over their craft and duel with each other to fuel their obsession is engaging and thoroughly entertaining. Obsession over their craft is not the only fuel to their dynamic though.

Part 1: <i>The Roses</i> review
Part 2: Jacob’s incredibly snobby take on theater etiquette

1/ <i>The Roses
</i>Resentment is a heavy topic to explore and to do it with comedy is extremely impressive. It’s a struggle that most face in some way or another and it can be utterly debilitating.

The duo of Benedict Cumberbatch and Olivia Colman really could not have mastered this dynamic much better. Certainly helps that they are British for the comedy because I thought they were simultaneously elegant and romantic as well as hilarious and sinister 

If it weren’t for what you’ll read next, I think this would be rather higher. 

2/ Theater Etiquette
Going to the movies is by far my favorite past time. An escape from life where you feel immerse in whatever story is being presented to you.

This escape can be ruined if in the presence of people who don’t give a shit about others.

Unfortunately tonight I was surrounded by the worst kind of people. 

To my right: two high school aged guys who chatted throughout the 1hr 30min runtime, used their phones every 5 minutes (because there is something wildly more important than the movie on there), and even accused me of being in their seats (I wasn’t)

To my left: originally a man who repeatedly coughed on me until he moved to a different seat because he want in the right seat to begin with, then some dude who commented on quite literally every scene in the movie with the phrases, “That’s so crazy”, “She’s so crazy”, or “He’s so crazy. This absurd man also took his shoes off and got his bare ass feet on my chair about half way through the movie.

To say that I was bothered by this experience and it ruined the movie would be an understatement. Typically an early showing means douchebags like me who take movies too seriously are seated throughout the auditorium. Not tonight :(

2025-09-22,Apollo 13,1995,https://boxd.it/b8Pecx,5,Yes,"Hello my movie watching friends! I am back!

It’s been a busy month, but I am back with an absolute banger. <i>Apollo 13 </i>has forever been one of my favorite movies. I’d venture to guess I watched it as a young lad with my dad and rewatched it every single time it was on cable.

It’s been a few years now since I had last watched, but this time in IMAX! Tickets were booked well in advance (I’m talking months…), and I have been heavily anticipating this showing.

There’s something about this movie that just hits in every single way for me. The slight American propaganda for American Excellence, the engineering and problem solving, the period piece nature, and of course the space travel all just make my dopamine receptors fire on all levels.

The great part about rewatching movies is picking up on new things and recognizing some of the nuances that you never saw before. As I grow into the film bro that I am becoming, and maybe already am, I notice this more and more as I rewatch my favorite films. Details I noticed this time around for Apollo 13 included Lovell’s selfishness for achievement, NASA operating as a military machine that runs on purely on public opinion, or the monumental stress that flowed through the families of the astronauts.

The last of those points were certainly present to all viewers, but I think missed them a lot as a kid watching this. As I grow up I relate more and more with the families. What goes through their heads as they watch their husband, dad, son fly through space with complete uncertainty is terrifying. I think age has changed my perspective on the movie, moving away from the inspiring story of saving astronauts through science, imagination, and sheer will to a view that understands how important family is and how if the mission was not a success failure would have truly destroyed families.

Thanks for reading y’all! There  are some bangers coming up soon so please stay tuned.

2025-09-29,One Battle After Another,2025,https://boxd.it/bdaZ6z,5,,"There’s so much about this that just absolutely fucking rocked. Let’s run through a few together!

<b>1. The Soundtrack</b>
I like to think that I know ball when it comes to music. Clearly I fucking don’t because I did not know who Jonny Greenwood was until I listened to the soundtrack again on the Flatbush Ave bound 2 train on the ride back to Brooklyn. Holy hell does this dude know how to make music. Piano scores where chaos is the key focus have a special place in my heart and he hit the nail on the head with this one.

My dad and I always talk about and listen to Gershwin, and my dad will tell me how his brain was basically just exploding with notes to be played on the piano. If you know his music it reflect well to that sentiment. All the scenes with accompanying piano in the movie have the same beautiful anxiety filled theme.

<b>2. The Performances</b>
Folks who should we start with? It’s hard to say who kicked more ass between Leo and Sean Penn.

Leo you expect to be great. He’s a household name, the premier actor of his generation, and probably my favorite actor of all time. You expect him to carry this movie to glory. 

Well the movie could do it all on its own but Leo fucking kills it. He’s a geeked out, paranoia filled, lunatic who just wants what’s best for his little girl. Honestly he’s just every dad in America. He’s got crazy dad lore that he never tells his kids.

Let’s move on to who I think has the best performance: Sean motherfucking Penn. A few thoughts, (1) wow did they pump him full of TRT, (2) he’s a lunatic, (3) autism is a superpower, (4) I don’t think there could be a better casting. Sean Penn is just amazing in this, whether it’s his herky jerky walk, his delusions of grandeur, or his ability to crank up the outbursts, he did not miss. I will be on the Oscar hype train for him without a doubt.

<b>3. IMAX 70MM and 1.43:1</b>
I have said it before, and I will continue to say it, there is nothing better than being seated in Auditorium 13 at AMC Lincoln Square knowing you get to be as immersed as humanly possible in a movie for 2-3 hours.

There’s a few scenes here that are just movie magic. Anytime I get the chance to be at a showing in this format, I will be seated. Every time I am seated, I am blown away. 

Going full aspect ratio for almost three hours was a new level of immersion that’ll be hard to top. I’m sure it will though (I’m talking to you Christopher Nolan… The Odyssey better not miss).

<b>4. The Commentary
</b>A right of passage as we age is a growing interest and understanding of the importance of politics. Growing up I avoided it like the plague, but over the years I have taken more and more of an interest in knowing what’s going on and understanding the implications of the decisions that are made.

With that, I am loving movies that dive into these topics. Eddington earlier this year was a masterpiece in this area. One Battle After Another hits on so many of the same fronts but adds such an exciting element of action and comedy. I am going to struggle deciding which I liked more.

2025-10-04,The Smashing Machine,2025,https://boxd.it/bg2oKt,3.5,,"When I tell you that I wanted nothing more than to absolutely love this movie, I mean it. Unfortunately I just didn’t.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s a good movie. I just had very high hopes that I would be great and was let down that it wasn’t.

Let us start with the positives.

Emily Blunt. She is perfect. No other words need to be uttered, just sheer perfection.

The score is wonderful. The upright bass sprinkled throughout keeping the scenes moving with interjections from all other band sections is phenomenal.

I think the Rock was actually quite impressive. He’s got an incredibly complex character to play who goes from periods of complete rage to catatonic states. He also is so unbelievably jacked that it’s impossible not to be in awe. He should be nominated for Best Actor, but I don’t think he will or should win.

Moving on to the negatives…

Honestly there’s just nothing that makes you connect to the characters here. They aren’t particularly relatable, the story doesn’t move you in such a way that you feel compelled to root for them all that much, and their world feels like it’s an alternate universe.

The movie is incredibly raw. Maybe this is what Benny Safdie, who by the way did a surprise intro at my showing which was very cool, was going for. Each scene starts and ends with a feeling that can only be summarized as “What the fuck is going on?”, “Who is experiencing what?”, and “Why am I not connecting with this scene?”

It felt almost like you are just in the room as a fly on the wall for half of the scenes but you are going in and out of an observer role to a role of with deep pure emotion with no fluid transition.

My last comment on elements that I didn’t like is that I think there needed to be more commitment to one direction of the story. The movie has a bunch that it could’ve gone down. It could’ve been a fighting movie, a straightforward biopic, or some sort of drama around a life of fame and struggles with relationships, drugs, and chasing the dragon. I think it tried to do all of these and should’ve committed to one or another.

No? Just me?

Well, my recent one is chess. Randomly got the urge to play about a month ago and have since become an addict. Now don’t get me wrong, I am horrific at the game, but boy is it fun to play. My ratings could not be much lower, but I am learning bit by bit the complexity of this game and even better learning much of the history of its relevance in geopolitics, especially as it relates to the Cold War.

The show wraps much of the history I’ve learned as of recent up with its own fictitious story. Anya Taylor-Joy is honestly quite exceptional in her role as Beth. She is this deeply troubled, yet exceptional, prodigy. Her deep rooted trauma propels her towards excellence and holds her back over and over.

I greatly wish there was more of this show, but at the same time am quite glad it is just a limited series. In our world of excess content and increasingly slop filled social media feeds, it is refreshing to watch something that feels incredibly human, to the point, and not overdrawn.

His portrayal of Ben Richards is absolutely no different. He tugs on your heart strings, makes you laugh, and keeps you rooting for him throughout.

I got to see this opening night and was blessed with a Q&A with the director, Edgar Wright. Any time I get these opportunities it is so insightful getting the perspective of the people who made the movie happen. One of the points he made that I really loved what in reference to the retro-futuristic design of the environments. He pointed out how boring the use of smart phones can be in movies and that recognizing this they decided to go all in on the use of analog devices. Whether it is the VHS tapes, cassettes, or the clam shell like recording device used to mail in his daily recordings, the analog feel contrasts starkly to that of the high class society. 

The difference in feel when seeing how each set of people in society operate with their environment and devices available really helps to set the tone for the viewer.

The Avatar series is in a class of its own when it comes to movie magic. You sit down for three hours (hopefully in IMAX 3D) and are teleported into this beautiful, inspiring, complex world. 

It’s hard to even describe just how visually stunning this is. Every scene has such extreme attention to detail. You feel like you are actively participating in the story the way the character, scenery, and elements pop out from the screen and into your mind. There’s one scene in particular involving the sun that is actually absurd how cool it was to watch.

The movies only pitfall is that the story isn’t particularly compelling. It’s just the same story as the first two. It plays on plenty of historical, societal, and cultural themes and allows the viewer to draw their own interpretations of the story. But it’s just not particularly new or interesting as a story.

Every performance over the last few years has stripped away that hate for pure awe. The man is the best actor of my generation and he is really just getting started. Marty Mauser is such an excellent role for him. He’s cocky, arrogant, passionate, and just has this unwavering charisma.

I am not sure if he has a better performance than Leo for the Oscars this year but I don’t think anyone would be upset if he took the crown. Just exceptional job Timmy. Well done!

Now Josh Safdie.

This dude has the fucking sauce. This movie, the aesthetics, storytelling, pacing, witty humor, and just all around vibe are immaculate. It is quite literally everything I was hoping<i> The Smashing Machine</i> would be.

As an <i>Uncut Gems</i> stan, this is a perfect follow up for the series of scumbag New Yorkers who seem to consistently gain the trust of friends, family, and even strangers despite never deserving it.

I feel like there’s so much more to say but I can’t even get it across in this review. The passion, the culture around the marketing, the pursuit of greatness, everything. This movie is timeless and will not be forgotten any time soon.

Was watching this on cable with my mom while we had some time to kill on Christmas Eve. About halfway through the movie some serious wind swept through our neighborhood. We could hear some branches falling off the nearby trees and trickling off the roof of the house. There was one particularly loud branch but we thought nothing of it.

About 30 minutes pass and my puppy, Roo, decided to rise from being curled up under a blanket and headed to the sliding door to go outside in the backyard, likely to just use the bathroom.

I let her out and followed along to check that the gates were closed (sometimes my parents forget to close them and I get very anxious). I checked each gate and went back to Roo who was by the back of the fence. I look up and notice that a huge branch had broken off our neighbors tree and absolutely destroyed one section of our fence. A fun little Christmas present for us to deal with. Good news is no one was hurt, our house and the neighbors are fine, and Roo can still frolick around despite the damage that occurred.

I only got to 3/4 of the movie because I went to deal with this situation, but I thought it was actually extremely cute. Watching this the day after a series of pictures of Bill Clinton were released in the Epstein files was also great timing.","cable, with mom, with roo",2025-12-24

The few trailers I had seen leading up to this left me with a tame but lingering excitement. Something about Will Arnett always draws you in. Regardless I didn’t have any expectations since this hasn’t been heavily marketed and there’s minimal buzz going around as far as I know.

The movie is extremely well written. Bradley Cooper has a way of writing extremely relatable characters who you can connect with within a few moments. His character especially was exceptional and he killed the part.

Will Arnett was fucking hilarious and his chemistry with Laura Dern was palpable. The entire movie feels so raw and gritty but their relationship has this pure nature to it that sells itself so well through its humor and humility through the screen.

On the topic of the movie feeling raw, Bradley Cooper captures the feelings of NYC life and NYC Metropolitan Area suburban life exceptionally well.

The way it is told is incredible and makes it worthy of a rewatch off the bat. But something about the third act feeling incomplete left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth.

The entirety of the first two acts builds this complex world with characters of immense importance. Every scene feels tense, anxious, and exciting. You are filling in pieces of information bit by bit, but never really understand the whole picture. I kept thinking to myself “what are we building up to?”. Whatever that build up was, I was mentally preparing for something jaw dropping (something like The Departed came to mind).

By the third act I thought we were there, that big moment was going to come and I was going to be blown away. But it just never happened. I felt incomplete.

Once I got to the train and read a single review, my perspective completely flipped. This wasn’t a story for a big ending. This is a story about history, the practice of archives, and how history, stories, memories, and archives are incomplete. We can take as much physical artifacts, human testimonies, and personal anecdotes, but sometimes stories are incomplete and all we can do is attempt to fill in the gaps.

As I reflect on the movie, it captures this without even trying to seemingly. Wagner Moira’s character is spending all this time working at an identification center in search of some remnant of his mother’s existence. The future state is documenting these tapes about his story. The entire time everyone is just struggling to put all the pieces together.

While the third act threw me off at first now it feels almost fitting. It was extremely human. A woman who has labored away at archiving this man’s story, and the son of the man who barely remembers any of it. It’s actually quite genius.

2026-01-24,Train Dreams,2025,https://boxd.it/cNaO6F,4.5,,"Ok Netflix, I wasn’t familiar with your game. This is beautiful, inside and out. 

On the outside, it may be the most aesthetically beautiful film of the year. Every shot has this warm rich contrast that exudes beauty through the screen.

Inside, it is quite a touching story that is carried heavily by Joel Edgerton. 

For the stories perspective, I’d like to start by mentioning that I often imagine wonder what it must’ve been like to be a person living through this era. The hyper rapid advancement of technology had humanity going from the Wright Brothers first flight of 12 seconds in 1903 to having man walk on the moon 66 years later. This is an extreme jump in ability in a relatively short period of time. All of the little jumps make a big change in the lives of every day people. Seeing this from the perspective of someone who went from no flight to the moon must be staggering. 

The movie does an excellent job with this concept and keeping it really simple. Trees are the life blood to our world. 100+ years ago we began the significant effort of deforestation by hand, adding machines piece by piece, and later automating the entire process. A persons entire life can seemingly change in the blink of an eye, even if it is years, just with the change of technology. Without adapting you are always left behind.

The second part of the beauty of this movie is that it gives important perspective to the role people, relationships, connections, and family play in our world. Today we are growing ever more disconnected from each other. We move further towards a “WALL-E” lifestyle of isolation and complacency in letting technology run our lives. At the same time things like loneliness, depression, and anxiety seem to be at all time highs. We are missing connections with each other. The story in Train Dreams sees the value in connections. When he loses his family, he is starved for connection and finds ways to connect back with others. He deeply values the small connections he makes. Even Willis H Macy’s character looks at his surroundings with the trees and anyone with a smiling face as “family”. Connection and relationships with others, communities, and even surroundings were as important in this era as they are now.

Aside from all the beauty the movie was a bit slow moving. Having to be forced to watch this at home as it barely played in theaters, if at all, is a bit disappointing. Would’ve loved the full immersion on the big silver screen.","netflix, with roo, oscar noms 2026 marathon",2026-01-23

I’ve never been so scared by something so stupid. I thought the first movie was well done so I had hopes but if you have to explain the plot out loud in the movie, you should probably think of something new to write about.","peacock, with kaitlyn, with roo, kaitlyn review",2026-01-25

This is meant for a theatrical experience and the at home viewing experience just doesn’t cut it. The story isn’t enough to carry you through the whole movie. You need the seat vibrating sound from the beautiful score. You need the light shining through the projector onto the big silver screen. Even with the expanded ratio at home it just isn’t the same.

Going to everyone’s favorite third place (the Lincoln Square IMAX) this weekend to run this back while it’s re released. Will report back again.","max, with kaitlyn, with roo",2026-01-28

2026-02-01,The Perfect Neighbor,2025,https://boxd.it/cVgxeB,4,,"Splitting this review up into two parts for y’all:
1/ Thoughts on the doc
2/ A quick anecdote of my former neighbor (don’t worry he wasn’t a murderer)

1/ Thoughts:
This is a fascinating way of storytelling. It is raw, unfiltered, and true to the fact. That being said it felt unbelievably invasive to watch. I’m sure the real people in this consented and/or got some sort of compensation, but it just felt wrong to watch true human experiences unfold and be broadcasted to the world. The poor child who’s mother passed will have to live with the fact that his reaction is shown in this documentary for the rest of time. He will never get to reliquinsh that memory and moment of pain because of this doc. It feels wrong.

2/ Anecdote:
When I was growing up, our next door neighbor was this sweet old woman. My earliest memories were of her on her own in that house, but she had been there long before myself or my parents arrived. She I believe bought the plot of land way back in the day when our suburban neighborhood was being developed, raised her children, lived an entire life with her family in that home. She was an excellent neighbor and everyone around the block was always ready to help her when she needed something. Unfortunately when I was around 16 or so, she passed.

The house was small, built in the 30s, but the plot was extremely valuable and in a great location with great school, access to NYC, etc. Naturally, a rich millennial couple came in and purchased the home. I forget the wife’s name, but the guys name was Matt. Matt is “Perfect Neighbor” in question.

They bought the property and spent the first couple years not really living there because they were gutting the place, remodeling, adding a second floor, and a slew of other improvements. So far no major issues. Once they finally did move in things started to really change.

My neighborhood growing up was a lot of boomer aged families, kids always running up and down the streets playing, block parties with ice cream trucks, etc. Matt & wife were probably the first millennials and they didn’t really fit into the typical behaviors of our other neighbors. They, mostly him, were shrewd, disrespectful, and just generally unpleasant.

Over the few years they lived there I specifically had the cops called on me at least 10 times. I am a very respectful and kind kid, even when I was a shithead teenager. There was no situation in which calling the cops was justified. A few examples when I had cops called on me were, having beers in my backyard playing music with buddies. We were all 21 and music was very quiet because we were just sitting around a fire. The cops were called at 10:01 PM, right after you can put in for a noise complaint.

I had the cops called on me for parking on the street in front of their house. Given that it was a public road, the cop wasn’t really sure what to tell me to do for this one. We kept parking there when people would come over because we knew it would piss him off.

My favorite and last story was from the night after a big snowstorm. I was home from college and got up relatively early to try and get what had snowed so far off the drive way and clear the cars out. It was still really coming down at this point and we had maybe 7 inches on the ground. I was shoveling and tossing snow anywhere I could to clear things off. I had some music playing and was just vibing along for about 30-45 min. Next thing I know, I look up and an Allendale PD (my hometown) car is at the base of my driveway. I know it had to be something from this douche Nextdoor, but what could it possibly be? All I had done that day was shovel my fucking driveway.

Well I walk over and the officer is just disappointed that he even had to be there. Frankly it wasn’t safe to be driving. I ask him what was wrong and he says “Your neighbor made a complaint that you were throwing snow into his yard”. I genuinely don’t remember what my reaction was but I can say it was disbelief. I was asked to stop throwing snow that way by the officer and he drove away. I did not oblige given that I had no where else to put the snow. 

A few years later, and a few more police calls later, they moved out. Moral of my story… don’t be a shitty neighbor and don’t waste the time of police officers.","netflix, documentary, oscar noms 2026 marathon",2026-01-30
2026-02-01,Send Help,2026,https://boxd.it/cVqQGT,4,,"This was just such a fun watch!

There is a certain energy in the air when a movie is really not trying to do too much except entertain you and escape reality for 2 hours. Send Help does a phenomenal job in just that.

The story is engaging and thought provoking but not too complex. The performances are hilarious, energetic, and filled with passion. Rachel McAdams and Dylan O’Brien have great chemistry in that they probably like each other in real life and get along well but seemingly deplore each other’s characters.

The sound in Dolby was also excellent and made the experience just that much better. Couldn’t recommend to people more!","theater, amc lincoln square, dolby",2026-01-31

2026-02-02,Sinners,2025,https://boxd.it/cWw03B,5,Yes,"It took 4 watches but I am finally caving and giving this the 5 star rating that it deserves.

Round 4 overall, but round 3 in the glorious IMAX 70MM format at the wonderful AMC Lincoln Square. After each watch I’ve grown to appreciate this film more and more. As of the most recent watches ,both in the last week, I can truly state that to enjoy this is to enjoy the theatrics. 

Sinners went above and beyond for its audiences. There was a reason why the fanfare exploded when it first released and why demand for re releases has not relinquished. The big screen is an experience and Sinners was curated with that magic in mind. 

My last two watches, at home and now today, have put this into perspective just that much more. This story and experience is overflowing with passion. You can see how obsessive Coogler was in creating something meaningful and memorable. To do all of this in a genre like horror is exceptional. 

While I don’t care for vampires much, Sinners has grown on me and I will be so excited to see their team accept award after award in a few weeks.","theater, amc lincoln square, imax 70mm, imax",2026-02-01
